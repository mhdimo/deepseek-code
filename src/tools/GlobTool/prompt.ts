export const GLOB_TOOL_NAME = "Glob";

export const DESCRIPTION = `- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead
- You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance.`;
